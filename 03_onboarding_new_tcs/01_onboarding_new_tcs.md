# Onboarding New Technical Coaches

As a Technical Coach Lead, you may be responsible for onboarding new Technical Coaches. At a high level, there are many things that need to be done:

  - Add to Slack channels: `#technical-coaches`, `#tc_updates`, `#tc_support`, `#tc_updates`, `#labs-escalation` channels
  - Update role to Technical Coach on Instructor App
  - Add to Flatiron Labs organization on Github so they can view `learn-support` and `technical-coach-resources` repositories
  - Have them compete Technical Coach Training curriculum track
  - Have them shadow 2 experienced/senior TCs on screenshares
  - Perform 3 mock screenshares with them to get them comfortable with working with students and the coaching process
  - Observe them at least 3 times during their first week / first shift to see how they're performing, and give them any feedback
  - Be available to help with any questions or problems that might arise

In some cases, you might be responsible for onboarding them, but they may not be joining your team. In this case, you'll want to transition them over to their team by the end of the first week. We want them to get comfortable with their team members as well as going to their TCL for help in the future. By the end of the second week, they should be up to speed and fully onboarded into their team. 

This might seem like a lot, but fortunately for you, we have some excellent documentation on how to do all of these things, which you can find here:

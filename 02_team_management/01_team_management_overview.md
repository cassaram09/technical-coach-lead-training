# Team Management Overview

This module covers best practices for managing your team.

## Communication

You should find the preferred mode of communication of each team member (eg Slack, email, texting etc). 

### Slack Channel
You should have a team Slack channel. If you're inherting an existing team, the channel probably exists already. If you're creating a new team, you'll need to create the channel on slack. You're encourages to post in this channel to keep your team members engaged. While some TCs might have full time jobs or other obligations that prevent them from being consistently active in the channel, it's still up to us to build community in whatever way we can. This can be as simple as posting `Good morning!` in the channel every day. 

### Weekly Emails
A weekly email is a good way to keep your team abreast of what's happening at Flatiron, as well as any other news they should be aware of. Since some team members are not active in Slack, email is critical for keeping them in the loop. Topics to include in the weekly meeting can include any new TCs that might be joining your team, reminders to do peer observations, or any other general updates. 

## Team Meetings
Team meetings are not _necessary_ but highly encouraged - however, it's up to you to decide how frequently you'll meet with your team. Teams with high engagement and TCs who are frequently available can meet every week. Some teams have TCs who are more experienced and have full time jobs - it is typically more difficult to rally them together for a meeting, so bi-weekly meetings might a better choice. 

Team meetings should be 15 - 30 minutes long, preferably when everyone is off shift if possible. Try to find a time that works for everyone and schedule it a few days in advance so your team members are aware of it. Meeting topics can include professional development, feedback from TCs, or just general QA. Generally, try to make this time as productive if possible. If there's no good reason to have a meeting, you may want to skip it altogether. 

## Individual Meetings and Observations
As a Technical Coach Lead, you're responsible for observing and meeting with your team members twice a month, for about 15 - 30 minutes. Topics to discuss can include:
  * How they're doing generally ( eg working on side projects? looking for a job? etc)
  * How they feel in the role
  * Feedback ( if necessary )
  * General QA

For the observations, you should observe the team member on a screenshare, take notes on their performance, and then provide them with feedback. Be sure to submit this in the Peer Observation Feedback form, and refer to the Best Practices for Feedback document. 

These sessions can be separate, or can be combined. Feedback should be given as quickly as possible after the observation while it's still fresh for you and the TC you were observing. In this case, you can opt to combine the 1:1 and feedback session into one meeting. Shadow the TC, then have them `qbot out` so you can review the feedback with them, as well as cover any 1:1 topics. Since they're on shift, you would want to keep this to 15 minutes, especially if it's busy.

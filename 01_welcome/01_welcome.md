# Welcome 

We're excited to have you join us as a Technical Coach Lead (TCL). In this role, you'll continue to work with students in various capacities (AAQ, Study Groups, or 1:1 Support) but also manage and grow your team of TCs to ensure they're able to do their jobs to the best of their ability!

## Getting Started

As a TCL, you'll be interacting not only with your squad (team), but with many other members of the Flatiron staff. To help build our community and productivity among remote employees, we engage in a number of practices on Slack and have several meetings during a typical week.

### #section-leads Slack Channel
Around 8am ET, many staff members greet each other in the `#section-lead` channel with phrases like `Good morning!` or `Morning everyone!`. This helps us to build community and relationships with one another, even though we're not working in the same physical space. 

### Daily Standup
Tuesday through Friday we have a daily stand up meeting at 1pm ET, which lasts for 15 minutes. Each person says what they are doing that day ( what did earlier today, and what they have planned for the rest of the day). At the end of the meeting, team members can raise any _bits or pieces_ - items they need help with or general questions. If you are going to miss daily standup for some reason (eg you have a meeting with a student), post in the `#section-lead` channel that you will be async and what you would have said.

### Weekly Online Group Meeting
On Mondays at 1pm ET, we have an hour long meeting of full time instruction employees (eg section leads, TCLs, etc). Each person goes through their win of the week (what you think went really well last week) and what you're excited for this week. The rest of the meeting usually covers department metrics, and any other special topics. If you are going to miss this meeting for some reason, post in the `#section-lead` channel that you will be async and what you would have said.

### Weekly Flatiron Meeting
On Tuesdays at 12:15pm ET, we have our weekly Flatiron meeting, which lasts for 45 minutes. We typically cover high level information on what's happening at Flatiron. During this meeting, you should mute yourself, keep your video off, and watch for any chatter in the `#roundup` Slack channel.

### WeWork Company Meeting
Occasionally, we will attend WeWork company meetings, which last about 2 hours. These meetings usually cover high level information and happenings at WeWork. Similar to the weekly Flatiron meeting, you should mute yourself and keep your video off. These meetings are recorded and are available for viewing in the [WeWork video archive](https://connect.we.co/display/WACM/All+Company+Home).

### Bi-weekly Online Social
Bi-weekly on Mondays afternoon, we have an hour long social meeting of the full time instruction employees where we'll play games or do some other social activity. Attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged as it's a great way to get to know your coworkers better!
